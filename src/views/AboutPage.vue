          A collaborative platform for learners and educators to secure learning
          continuity in times of restrictions and beyond. A simple tool for
          teachers to create teaching content without any advance knowledge of a
          tool or code. They create by using various media and graphics from the
          open stock libraries and merging it with their own content to keep it
          engaging and diverse.

      <div class="info">
        Theoretical knowledge online is what most universities have achieved,
        but practical training online so far seems unique. We are building tools
        to auto-generate (convert) text-based content to video-based online
        content with an extension towards gamification and immersive techniques
        for advanced pieces of training. Vision to ensure learning continuity
        for all. Standardized education and access to all with equal
        opportunities to educational processes.
        <br />
        In the education system, more than 90% of students are impacted by
        school and university closures. The map is a depiction of countries that
        are experiencing lockdown in terms of a countrywide or a localized
        lockdown. The education sector and an estimated 1.5 billion students
        were affected worldwide due to these lockdowns. Learning has been
        disrupted due to the pandemic, and there is a requirement for a new
        education model.
